for demo of a number of different pose files

setup to compile for both posix and windows project as long
as glut is installed.

--------------------------------------------

Cat drawn using only drawEllipse wich uses solidsphere and scaling

Interpolation code based on linear interpolation between adjacent
key frame values for each attribute.  It is assumed that the last frame
is to be looped to the first so that there is an interpolation between 
last and first frame.

keyboard options include
	t key cycles between 2 segment tail, 20 segment tail, 20 segment tail
	with tail tip reverse angle (for S effect)

	a key cycles texture on and off for base.

	z key animates the floor when a texture is active.  floor moves at
	rate controlled by frame rate in the -x direction for use with run.txt

	h key hides/shows the colored axes


run.txt is a 4 frame animation simulating a cat running at full speed.
	best shows the tail options and enables S shape tails

Cat implemented with multiple degrees of freedom and exercised with
debug4.txt
	all legs have ability to rotate in z and y
	chest can rotate in x y and z
	head can rotate in x y and z
	body can rotate in x y and z
	body can translate in x y and z
	tail option, keyboard t to enable two special tail modes

rollover.txt =  cat sits, lays down, curls around
 looks around, rolls over
	 sitting cat  - rear legs splay in x rotation in addition to z.
	 laying down cat - front legs come together rotating around x in addition to z
	 curling cat, chest rotates in x and z
	 looking around cat, head rotates around x
	 rollover, rotations of chest xyz, head xyz and translation of body in z

debug4.txt is a modified version of debug.txt provided. It exercises and shows
	most of the extra degrees of freedom implemented as an add on to the 
	end of the file.
